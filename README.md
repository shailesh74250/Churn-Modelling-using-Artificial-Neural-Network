Bank Churn Modelling problem

ANN (Artificial Neural Network) that can predict, based on geo - demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, we are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probility of leaving. To do that, we will nedd to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.

dataset: In .tsv file the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc.

During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.
